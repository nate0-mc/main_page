    Welcome to my website! Read below if you are interested.
    <h2>| About Me</h2>
    > Hi! I am Natalie (formerly <del>Nathan</del>), or more commonly known online as nate0___. I am a math fanatic, and I like coding LaTeX documents. I am a 3rd-year high schooler.
    > I consider myself chronically online. <br>
    <br>
    > I am a gay femboy :3. I do not care about your views, by the way. Just let me be :P. <br>
    <br>
    > I am typer, meaning I just love to type. <br>
    > I am in love with the band AJR (Inertia Acoustic â™¡). I love typing reviewers, guides, or simple passages. <br>
    > I use Linux, specifically Fedora with KDE. (planning to move to Fedora with i3.)<br>
    > I do all my tasks on a laptop, a very low-range office laptop. I have two laptops, one running Linux off a USB and one running Windows 8.1 (do not ask why.) and Windows 11.<br>
    > I like playing Minecraft and Geometry Dash. <br> 
    > I might be <i>annoying to some</i>, but who knows? Maybe you'd find me like a talkative friend :D <br>
    > I am a very large sailor in real life. If you talk to me, I might swear at least more than three times. <br>
    > I am also incredibly into memes. Yes, I am one of those "Gen-Z" kids but I have my limits.

    <h2>| What is this website?</h2>
    > This website is mostly a <i>personal</i> one. This website is mostly just a place for me to share thoughts, opinions, or whatever the like. I also use this website to post my works (reviewers, guides, or more) involving mathematics, and to share stories about various things that have happened in my life. Some may be exaggerated, some may be short, or some may be long. If you are interested, you can browse the links. I do not want you to pay for anything, as I want information to be <i>free</i> in where I put it. All I ask is just a read of one paragraph, or even one sentence. Something that can make me feel great about me creating this website. I aso do not want to make every single element fancy, as I just want a simple website that works.

    <h2>| Articles</h2> - Blogs, or just math guides or insructions. <br><br>
    1) <a href="firstwebsite.html">My First Website</a>
    <h2>| My Works</h2>
    All my works; reviewers, guides, summaries, or outlines. They can be anything but math, like Grammar or maybe even just a random work with a moral. <br><br>
    <i>Nothing yet :></i>
    <h2>| Unrelated</h2>
    Just specifically some work that I do not consider as either works or articles e.g lists of random things, or other stuff. <br><br>
    <i>Nothing yet :></i>
