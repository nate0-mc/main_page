        Welcome dear reader! <br>
        <br>
        I am Natalie, or online as nate0___. I am a transgender girl who absolutely loves mathematics. My main socials can be found in the bottom of every page (although some are note listed<sup>1</sup>). I am a high school student, currently the third year (in a four-year system for high school.)   <br><br>
        Hobbies include (but not limited to):
        <ul>
            <li>Coding (HTML, CSS, <i>hopefully</i> Python)</li>
            <li>Playing the Ukelele (Stopped for a while)</li>
            <li>Listening to Music (I do this way too much.)</li>
            <li>Sudoku</li>
            <li>Reading books</li>
            <li>Typesetting \(\LaTeX\)</li>
        </ul>
        Other than that, my favorite artists are AJR and BoyWithUke. I love playing Minecraft and Geometry Dash (in that order). I consider myself chronically online. 
        <center><h2>Website Information</h2></center>
        The reason I created this website is so that I can share information and educate. Mathematics is one of my passions, and I want to show that passion by educating. I also want to share my work; the many mathematics guides I have made for my classmates can't just go to waste. I spend a minimum two weeks preparing these reviewers, so I can't imagine just using them only once and never again. <br><br>

        That's why this website was made. I want to: a) educate people, b) to share my work, and c) to document my life. My blog exists just so I can share my experiences to at least a crowd of two people. <br><br>

        <center><h2>Latest Page</h2></center>
        Currently work in progress!
