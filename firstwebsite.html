    <center><h1>My First Website</h1></center>
    <center><h3>May 25, 2024</h3></center>

    I: <b>INTRODUCTION</b> - Creating this website is something that I never thought I could make. This is just a random idea that I thought I could make, to share my thoughts to someone (at least!), and even if it does not reach somebody, I still feel like having a website is important. Currently, I am typing this blog in Neovim, and currently trying to endure to ensure for memorability of how the keybinds of neovim works. <i>Remember, :q to escape vim or neovim!</i>. An introduction to this website is already in the Main Page, however I feel like I should reiterate it. This website is mostly <i>personal</i>. It may consist of blogs/articles (not news articles, I have zero skill on taking information related to that!), or to post various insights or summaries on mathematics. Or, to share my work that I have made at least. The website does not have fancy design, as I feel like having a more simple feel makes the website more open to more people rather than experiencing it worse rather than simply. Nothing is paid in this site. It is just ran by GitHub Pages, and I do not wish to make the information here paid. <br><br><br>
    II: <b>WHY DID I CREATE A WEBSITE?</b> - As stated previously, I want to share information. I feel like limiting my works to just a certain group is unfair. So, this is why I wanted to create something like this. Showing on what I feel, I wanted to create this site to show what I have been keeping in my head for how long I wanted to create. Another reason I never stated was that I wanted to share some person or whoever on my thoughts. Opinions, are of course, kept, but on specific ideas, I am more open to share what I feel like should be said. A reason, also, is to share my works. I have works that I feel like could be improved, but are my greatest feats to create (since coding LaTeX to me at those times was really steep.), and I wish to show what I made for people who need it or to those who are willing to provide criticism for me to improve. Maybe even sharing my works can also make my works more better and more properly made. An extra reason that I created this website is because just for bragging rights. My friends and classmates do not consider as amateur coders, yet I still believe that they can create a website for their thoughts to be heard. Bragging rights might seem somewhat narcissist, or selfish, or something else, but I feel like having the rights to tell that I have a website can send a spark to their neurons to think that, "Huh, I think I can create this website!". I literally am making this website through basic HTML 5, and with Neovim. See the imbalance of how the two collide? My point is, if I can brag (to an extent) on that I made a website, I hope that they can create a website with their own intentions as a motivator. Sure, it may be a stupid reason, but it is a weird one. <br><br><br>
    III: <b>MAKING THE WEBSITE</b> - Restated, I use Neovim (with NvChad) to create this website. I consider myself new to writing in Neovim, as I want to actually use a code editor that does not use the mouse to maneuver like an ordinary IDE. Even if it has a learning curve, the pain gives gain. I use Neovim in Linux, specifically Fedora with a KDE spin. I plan to switch to Arch Linux when I get a new computer, not just so I can get the rights to say "i use arch btw" but to actually get the experience of what the installation process of (most) Linux distributions go through. The host I use to create this website is GitHub Pages. It is just a simple Google search on how to set this up. Sign up for GitHub, create a public (more preferred) repository, and just do the rest by a simple search. I know, I am just lazy to type out the instructions. The website is made purely in HTML 5. I do wish to use JavaScript to actually make mathematics with figures, and retaining the simple, plain HTML 5 website like those in the 90's. Or maybe CSS for more diversability. But for now, I will use regular HTML 5. Making a website with JUST HTML 5 is already pretty incredible, and also very good for a beginner. All you need is to memorize the formatting of HTML 5, and the basics, and you can make an object-less blog. <br><br><br>
    IV: <b>MATH TYPESETTING</b> - Mathematics on HTML is basically unheard of if you are just using regular HTML. However, with specific scripts or JavaScript scripts (like MathJax), you can create mathematics (like in LaTeX) in HTML. As a demonstration: The quadratic formula \(\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\) in inline. The vertex form of a quadratic in regular math: \[f(x)=a(x+h)^2+k\] I use the MathJax script in order to typeset mathematics. Normally, I would use LaTeX, but if I can, I would use MathJax to share my summaries or definitions that involve mathematics. Of course, some stuff may be difficult to type, but eitherway, it is how it is. <br><br><br>
    V: <b>CONCLUSION</b> - Making this website might be a turning point for me. I code with normal HTML, with a MathJax script included to type mathematics, and using GitHub Pages to host it. I always think that creating this website is something that can help me share what my thoughts are. Anyone can create a site to share their ideas! Just do what I did step-by-step, and you will get a website with simple HTML. You do not need any fancy text, as long as you have an idea, you can share it. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
