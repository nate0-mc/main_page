            This story is a memorable one. It really defined a lot about my class' humor and the lasting impact this moment had. Side note, it is a little dangerous. What I am talking about was an incident, wherein, my friend, let's call her "B," almost got electrocuted and shocked by a plug (and no, she did not stick a fork.)
            <center>
                <h2>&rArr; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the Bang!</h2>
            </center>
            <p>
                An overview of what happened before was: we were setting up a group presentation, where we had to do a group project to make a set of slides to teach. There were six of us in our group, and we had to set and prepare our teacher's laptop (the presentation was on the laptop) by connecting it to the television.
            </p>
            <p>
                The weird thing was: way before that, the wire that connected the television and the plug below had been broken, or torn a little apart. The "kuyas" or the helpers in the school tried to fix it, but it had been repaired unsuccessfully. It was just taped; the dangers were not cited.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can tell, this brewed a little bit more before to set up this event. And to tell you about B, our "main character," she has been shocked by a charged wire once. She was returning upstairs, and the loud rains brought a lightning strike. It hit somewhere close enough to our school that it impacted a wire (from my knowledge) and struck her underneath it exactly. She said "she could've died."
            </p>
            <center>
                <h2>&rArr; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Bright Light </h2>
            </center>
            <p>
                Once we had set up the laptop with the presentation, we had to plug the TV in. Of course, we plugged it in to the outlet below. I was also going to plug in the HDMI cable to our teacher's laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, by now, what I have said earlier has probably dawned on you. <i>It is unsafe</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>From B's Perspective</b> - After she plugged it in, immediately she sensed something was wrong and plugged it out immediately. Then, she smelled something that reminded her of smoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                She immediately backed off! She knew something was wrong, but all of a sudden... <br><br>
                <i>POP !</i>
                <br><br>
                A loud pop noise can be heard, like a balloon. Then, the outlet lit up; flashed us with a bright white light. She literally <i>could not understand anything</i>. After the flash, she couldn't hear anyone for a couple of seconds. It was like a loud noise went to her ear and started ringing when it calmed down. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone had to leave because of a smell that might be a big concern to them. It was a loud POP!, and the bright flash was as tall as three-quarters our whiteboard's height.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>From Our Classmate's Perspective</b> - Let's call our classmate "C." C was at the back, preparing something for the presentation. Minding his business, then suddenly... <br><br>
                <i>POP !</i>
                <br><br>
                A bright light fills the front as he looked to it wondering if they have plugged it in yet. He was concerned, let alone confused what happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, a pungent smell can be picked off after the sudden pop. He noticed it and immediately told everyone to leave the classroom. (Fortunately, I was wearing a mask.) From his view, the sudden flash covered a decent radius, near the door too (but not really near the door).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>From My Perspective</b> - I was going to plug in the HDMI cable to the teacher's laptop. She was standing right behind me, talking to a student. In front of me, B suddenly backed off, and we all know what happened... <br><br>
                <i>POP !</i>
                <br><br>
                I was close to the flash. It was SO bright. At the source (the outlet) the flash was at its brightest in a circle, like a flashlight. I was so shocked my voice became masculine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I never really noticed the smell, but I did notice how that could've ended the laptop's lifespan. If I did ever plug the HDMI cable to the teacher's laptop, who knows what would have happened. I would bet fifty percent that it would be damaged in some capacity.
            </p>

                <h2> &rArr; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Aftermath</h2>
            </center>
            <p>
                B was traumatized. Her hands were shaking to bits, and in a way such that it made her feel unsafe near any outlet. She ended up going home for her mental being to calm down.
            </p>
            <p>
                C called our advisor, let's call him "01." 01 was extremely concerned about how the wire managed to spark an outlet. He recalled to us that, he told the school about the issue with the wire and stuff, but all they did was put duct tape. Later on after they were informed, and they replaced the wire (which was the bare minimum).
            </p>
            <p>
                Our science teacher (yes, the same one who made us present) recalled that a proper technician should handle such things, and not people who know how to properly clean (too rude?)
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of us? We just made fun of the whole situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I get it is a little messy to start laughing about something like this, but we always do something like this to try cheer ourselves up and make it a memory. This exact moment has been engraved to the internal jokes we have in this class, and has become a part of it and its history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, B is fine as usual (as of writing), and yes, she did make light of the situation by joking around too (she's one of us, of course she'd do such a thing.)
            </p>

                <h3> &rArr; &nbsp; &nbsp; Misconception</h3>
            </center>
            <p>
                The title of this blog post is "That Time My Friend Almost Got Electrocuted," but she really almost died. Why electrocuted? Shouldn't it also be her second time? Well... she would be electrocuted if she was three fractions of a meter closer. So it makes sense.
            </p>
            <center>
                <h2> &rArr; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moral</h2>
            </center>
            ... don't forget to fix your wires? I am not the best to explain the moral of such a thing (let alone the scale of risk in the event in this post) really; it's not my forte.
