	<h2>| Description</h2>
    > This page is dedicated to the PDFs and other works that I have made.<br>
	<ol>
		<li><i>Guides</i> are documents that I have made for my class to review for their quarterly mathematics exam but re-explained to understand. I don't believe I can explain things very well, but I think I can do it to a point where people can understand a litle more. I plan to revamp these in the future in order to make it more explanable. These documents ARE lengthy, because I try my best to give a thurough description for my classmates hence are detailed. They are not meant to be notes, they are meant to be guides. They can be treated as reviewers but it is not my decision on your treatment of these documents. The guides have practice problems to help improve the reader's understanding of the topic.<br><br>
		My guides are in different formats, because some of them are from when I began doing LaTeX and some of the code format is beginner level, as well as the considerably weird typesetting. Anything beyond my second year of high school do not have practice problems.</li>
		<li><i>Notes</i> are from when I was self-teaching myself mathematics. I take notes of the topics I learn on a sheet of paper and I typeset to LaTeX afterwards. They are in many PDFS so I am currently trying to do a project to re-make and compile all of my notes into one PDF. <br><br>

	Anything marked with (!) have this sort of syndrome. They progressively advance to better formatting but more lengthy explanations. <br>
	Anything marked with (*) have more detailed explanations, a.k.a are lengthy (beyond 40 pages combined).
