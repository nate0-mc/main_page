                This page serves as my hub for all the work I have compiled with \(\LaTeX\). 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is one of my favorite hobbies to typeset \(\LaTeX\) and I have been doing it for over a year. I consder myself an above-average beginner when it comes to it. The documents I have typeset over the long-run have been incredibly time-consuming but satisfying to work on. This page is to share these documents.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have three kinds of documents listed here:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Notes</b>: Self-explanatory. They are from my self-studies. So far, I have not released any of these because my notes are a mess and are hard to grasp fully. However, I am currently recompiling all my messy notes from College Algebra to one document.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Guides</b>: These are more detailed notes. They are more-so to explain in a hopefully more simpler manner. Due to this, they can take up to 60 pages per quarter. Generally, these are for reviewing and practicing for a quarterly exam. I only started doing this in the last quarter of the second year of high-school, so anything before that is not available (albeit I'll try make one.) Click the following dropdown(s) for the list.

                            <summary><i>High School</i></summary>
                            Some topics are omitted due to school suspensions, typhoons, and lack of time to discuss. Don't ask me why, ask my school!
