            This page is dedicated to the list of blogs that I have made over time. Don't expect a long one; I only blog when I feel like it.

            <p>
                I wanted to make a habit on trying to capture certain events through words, and I thought blogging would be a great idea. Certainly, I had <i>some</i> issues trying to blog; namely the lack of motivation to do so. However, I decided that blogging would be a good idea because I wanted to recall memories more vividly throughout the time I wished to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I decided to start <b>blogging</b> again. By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog" class="a1" id="highlight" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, <i>a blog is an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style posts.</i> It seemed like fun; having a diary that I can share to other people who don't even know what went on in my life. It also helps build my fort for writing in general, because I will need it (for school, I meant.)

                <h2>Why?</h2>
            </center>
            <p>
                I love telling stories to people. If they like it, then it is probably interesting to you. I have many experiences to recount in my own words (nothing formal, just my expression) that I want people to hear. Even if there is no audience, I can always have a wall of text to read when I'm bored... because I wrote it.
