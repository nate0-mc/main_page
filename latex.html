            </center>
            <p>
                Whenever I make \(\LaTeX\) documents, I always try to make it look appealing. Before when I was starting out, I was on a stoic mindset of "it should be formal because I'm dealing with the same language researchers use for papers!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I have seen it more appealing to make them attractive to serve them more useful for the reader. You can see from the image on the bottom.

                <img src="media/image/sample-latex.png" height="700" alt="A LaTeX Sample of my .sty and .cls Files" style="border: dotted; border-color: aqua">
            </center>
            <br>
            How I made the document appearance is through the use of <tt>.sty</tt> and <tt>.cls</tt> files. I mostly use the <b>.sty</b> file for the packages for formatting and typesetting, and the <b>.cls</b> for the document layout and appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can download them here:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <a href="latex/notescls.cls" class="a1" id="highlight" target="_blank"><tt>notescls.cls</tt></a> -  Edit the footer and header in the file. Just find it, I don't want to explain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="latex/notesty.sty" class="a1" id="highlight" target="_blank"><tt>notesty.sty</tt></a> - The package has an option; <tt>kawaii</tt>. This makes the <tt>tcbtheorem</tt> boxes aesthetic coloring. When I have the time, I will put a comparison picture somewhere. Disable it and get a more vibrant coloring.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                If you do end up using these files, credit me only in the source (albeit PDF output is optional and appreciated too.)<br><br>

                <b>WARNING!</b> These files can be loaded independently from each other, but <i>compile your documents with LuaLaTeX.</i> Any other \(\LaTeX\) compiler excluding XeLaTeX won't work to my knowledge (XeLaTeX is outdated.)
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need a tutorial on how to add these files to your document, just <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=where+to+put+latex+custom+package" class="a1" id="highlight" target="_blank">use Google</a>. If you're too advanced for that, check out <a href="latex/file-tutorial.html" class="a1" id="highlight" target="_blank">this page</a>.

                <h2>How I make my TikZpictures</h2>
            </center>
            I am not that talented to learn TikZ (I am currently in the process of learning that right now) so I use a GUI editor to make the diagrams. The GUI is an online editor that is free (paid is optional),
            <a href="https://mathcha.io" class="a1" id="highlight" target="_blank">Mathcha.io</a>. <br><br>
            You already noticed from looking at the source code of my documents, everytime there is a tikzpicture it looks horrendous in its syntax. I just copy-pasted it from the site's drawing area.

                <h2>How I write my LaTeX source code</h2>
            </center>
            This is <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/latex-style-guide.html" class="a1" id="highlight" target="_blank">inspiration from Evan Chen</a>, since he did something like this too. Aside from a few exceptions, I always try to make my source code clean. Some source code I provide are not always like this (mostly because I was only a couple months into \(\LaTeX\).) <br><br>
            <a href="latex/Typesetting_and_Sample_PDF.pdf" class="a1" id="highlight" target="_blank">This PDF</a>  lists down how I style my source code, and serves as a sample PDF for the templating.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I use TeXmaker on Windows to make these documents. On Linux, I use Neovim with VimTeX and LazyVim.
                </li>
                <li>
                    LaTeX distribution on Windows is MikTeX, and on Linux it is TeXLive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I compile using LuaLaTeX, if that has not been clearer enough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you want to get started with LaTeX, I am not the girl to explain how the language works. But, you can always use Google. A starter editor is Overleaf, but once you get the hang of it, I HIGHLY recommend a local editor like TeXmaker or anything else other than Overleaf. <br><br>
                    Overleaf certainly has potential especially with cloud backups, but it is unbelievably inefficient and it has certain things a local editor would have for free.
